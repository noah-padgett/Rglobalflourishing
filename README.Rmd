# Rglobalflourishing

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Rglobalflourishing is to provides researchers interested in analyzing data from the Global Flourishing Study with a coordinated set of analyses.

WARNING: The package was set up to be user-friendly for researchers part of the GFS core team who mainly have experience with other statistical analysis software such as STATA, SAS, and SPSS. This package and implementation of the analyses for Wave 2 of the Global Flourishing Study does NOT conform to "tidy" principles in general. While some elements of tidy evaluation and syntax structure are used throughout, we did not implement everything with "tidyness" in mind. As such, we make no guarantees that the package will integrate or "play nice" with other packages.

## Installation

``` r
