# Rglobalflourishing

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Rglobalflourishing is to provides researchers interested in
analyzing data from the Global Flourishing Study with a coordinated set
of analyses.

WARNING: The package was set up to be user-friendly for researchers part
of the GFS core team who mainly have experience with other statistical
analysis software such as STATA, SAS, and SPSS. This package and
implementation of the analyses for Wave 2 of the Global Flourishing
Study does NOT conform to “tidy” principles in general. While some
elements of tidy evaluation and syntax structure are used throughout, we
did not implement everything with “tidyness” in mind. As such, we make
no guarantees that the package will integrate or “play nice” with other
packages.
